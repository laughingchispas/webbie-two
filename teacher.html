            I have also been trained in a number of Education Ministries in Europe, opening my mind to a variety of teaching pedagogies.

                    <h3>music teacher</h3>
                    <p> I am encouraging, supportive, and positive; I understand that each child will learn at his or her own pace.
                        In class, I demonstrate and model proper techniques and posture and give suggestions on
                        how to practice at home.
                    </p>
                    <h3>fun & discipline</h3>
                    <p> Mostly importantly, I will strive to always keep the lessons active and fun;
                        creating music should always be enjoyable for each of us.

                    <h3>the suzuki philosphy...</h3>
                    <p>...is grounded in the precept that [...] every child is born with remarkable potential and, when
                        given a stimulating musical surroundings and excellent training, each can learn to play an instrument.</p>

                    <h3>individual lessons</h3>
                    <p> I encourage children to have one individual class a week, even in the summer;
                        a consistent learning environment that favors progress.
                    </p>
                    <h3>group lessons</h3>
                    <p> Another important pillar to Suzuki education in the group class. The aspect of learning in a group,
                        like other activities for children (soccer, dance, etc.), creates a peer-peer environment,
                        foster relationships between children, and foments a natural form of motivation and enjoyment to playing like no other.

                    <p>An important distinction between traditional pedagogy and the Suzuki Method
                        is the involvement of parents in the learning process.</p>

                    <h3>the student, teacher, parent triangle</h3>
                    <p>The Teacher/Parent/Student relationship as described by the Suzuki Philosophy is an equilateral triangle.
                        Each part is equally important in sustaining a healthy relationship and cultivating optimal growth of the studentâ€™s musical education.
                        The three units must work together toward the same goal, relating with mutual respect.
                        <br><br>
                        Knowing the importance of a parent's role in a child's musical development,
                        I also teach the parent so that they are confident in how to help the student during practice during the week.
                    </p>
                    <h3> personal note </h3>
                    <p> In today's world, I feel we have less and less 'real' 'human' contact with our family members and friends. Nowhere is
                        this more a problem than with the relationship we have with our children. Having time every single day with our children that doesn't
                        revolve around the dialy routine, eating, getting ready for school, homework, meals etc. is crucial. Creating an atmosphere
                        where we teach discipline and commitment to an activity that we may not always feel like doing, but for which we will see progress,
                        is sadly missing in many young people's lives. This is a gift you give your child, your family, and yourself.
