        <h3> teaching experience </h3>
        <p> <i>I have been teaching for nearly 10 years in
            primary and private schools in the US, France and Spain as well at university and in adult education
            in Belgium. While I was trained as a Suzuki violin teacher in the US,
            I have also been trained in a number of Education Ministries in Europe, opening my mind to a variety of teaching pedagogies.</i>
