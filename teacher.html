            <h3> teaching background </h3>
            <p> I have been teaching for nearly 10 years in
                primary and private schools in the US, France and Spain as well at university and in adult education
               in Belgium. While I was trained as a Suzuki violin teacher in the US,
                I have also been trained in a number of Education Ministries in Europe, opening my mind to a variety of teaching pedagogies.

                    <h3>musical training</h3>
                    <p>My musical training began at the age of 6 at the Eastman School of Music.
                        From there, a Suzuki Violin student myself, I continued to study violin through University.
                        Currently, I am completing viola studies at the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp.</p>

                    <h3>music teacher</h3>
                    <p> As a music teacher, my job is to discover how each student learns and cater my teaching style to each of them.
                        I am encouraging, supportive, and positive; I understand that each child will learn at his or her own pace.
                        <br><br>
                        In class, I demonstrate and model proper techniques and posture and give suggestions on
                        how to practice at home.
                    </p>
                    <h3>fun & discipline</h3>
                    <p>    Mostly importantly, I will strive to always keep the lessons active and fun;
                        creating music should always be enjoyable for each of us.

                    <h3>the suzuki philosphy...</h3>
                    <p>...is grounded in the precept that [...] every child is born with remarkable potential and, when
                        given a stimulating musical surroundings and excellent training, each can learn to play an instrument.</p>

                    <p><i>"If love is deep, much can be accomplished." </i>- S. Suzuki</p>
                    <h3>student, teacher, parent triangle</h3>
                    <p> An important distinction between traditional pedagogy and the Suzuki Method is the involvement of parents in the learning process.
                        The Teacher/Parent/Student relationship as described by the Suzuki Philosophy is an equilateral triangle.
                        Each part is equally important in sustaining a healthy relationship and cultivating optimal growth of the studentâ€™s musical education.
                        The three units must work together toward the same goal, relating with mutual respect.
                        <br><br>
                        Knowing the importance of a parent's role in a child's musical development,
                        I will teach the parent so that they are confident in how to help the student during practice during the week.
                    </p>
                    <h3>individual lessons</h3>
                    <p> I encourage children to have one individual class a week, even in the summer.
                        This creates a consistent learning environment that favors progress
                    </p>
                    <h3>group lessons</h3>
                    <p> Another important pillar to Suzuki education in the group class. The aspect of learning in a group,
                        like other activities for children (soccer, dance, etc.), creates a peer-peer environment,
                        foster relationships between children, and foments a natural form of motivation and enjoyment to playing like no other.

                    <h3>the communicative method</h3>
                    <p>All my language classes are based on the communicative method of language acquisition whereby students are
                        immersed in situations that mirror real-life situations and therefore provide the students with the
                        tools to use the English they have learned in class out in the world.
